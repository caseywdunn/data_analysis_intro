# Introduction to data analysis

This is a series of resources and tutorials for modern practices in data analysis. It is geared toward biologists.

## Data analysis essentials

If data analysis and computation is going to be a significant part of your research, I strongly suggest familiarizing yourself with the following tools and topics:

- Getting around at the command line. 
- Version control with git and GitHub
- Regular expressions for text processing
- Python and/or R.
- If Python, then also:
  - Jupyter notebooks(https://jupyter.org/)
  - Pandas, numpy, and matplotlib libraries
  - Conda package manager
- If R, then also:
  - [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html) notebooks
  - Tidyverse libraries
- [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), a simple markup language for formatting in plain text.
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). I strongly suggest using this as your primary code editor, regardless of whether you use Python, R, or other languages.
- Using generative AI tools like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), ChatGPT, and Google Gemini to help learn, review, and write code.

## Resources

- [Practical Computing for Biologists](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/practical-computing-for-biologists-9780878933914?cc=us&lang=en&). Topics here are covered primarilly in chapters 8-10, but other chapters are relevant too.
- [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/). Read this book cover to cover if you use python. We will focus on the materials in chapters 2-3.
- If you use R, many of the same topics are covered in [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). Read this book cover to cover if you use R.

## Preparations ahead of first meeting

Before the first class, please do the following:

- Get a github account - https://github.com/ . Make sure your academic email is registered with the account, it can be primary or secondary.
- Activate your free academic GitHub copilot account. It may take a few days to activate, so be sure to do it well before class - https://github.blog/2022-09-08-github-copilot-now-available-for-teachers/ .
- Install VS Code - https://code.visualstudio.com .
- Install miniconda - https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html .

Optional:
- If on Windows, install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install .
- If you use R, install R https://cran.r-project.org/
